git reset <X>? --> Removes from staging area (after add)... All or some?

git log --> Remeber to use this to see what commits have been made

git diff --> remeber to use before adding files

git pull --> always use before you push!!! (maybe even bfore adding?)

git branch <X> --> creates new

git branch --> no arguments mean it shows them.

git checkout <X (remote)> --> switches



------------------ When branching -----------------



(For inital commit/push to new branch)
git push -u origin <name>   
	--> pushing to remote (-u associates local and remote) origin represents where we push to <http://...>

git merge --> when called prior to merge, this always shows braches with changes to be merged
(or maybe git brnach merge.... try both)

git merge <X> -->when called with argument merges branch <X> into the one you are currently on.
  
git push origin main --> after merging on local repo remember also to move changes to remote

git branch --merged --> shows all branches merged to current branch

git branch -a --> shows all branches we are rocking at the moment

-----------deleting branches

$ git branch -d <work-local-changes> ---> deletes local branch


git push origin --delete <work-local-changes> --> deletes branch on remote
